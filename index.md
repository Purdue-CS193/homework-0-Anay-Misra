# Anay Misra's First CS193 Homework

My list of favourite things about CS193
- It is a wonderful course designed help Computer Science/Data Science/AI students like me with content that is otherwise not covered in the University Curriculum but essential for future careers.
- The class is not unnecessarily stressful for students
- The instructors of the course are very helpful
